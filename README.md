# Ratational
This C++ program takes in input as a fraction (ex. 3/5) and is able to to do rataional math with another fraction. 

The datatypes supported by Rational include:
  - int
  - double
  
The opertations Rational is able to perform are:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Division
  - Multiplication
  - Greater than and Greater Than or Equal too
  - Less than and Less than or equal too
  - Incremet Addition
  - Increment Subtraction
  - Comparison Equals and Not Equals too
 
 One key feature of the Rational Program is that the program will automatically reduce the fraction giving the answe is the smallest fraction possible.
 
 One limitation of Rational is that the program is only able to take in 2 fractions at a time.
 
 ## How To Run Rational
  1. Clone this repo by pasting `git clone https://github.com/Joshua-Sutton/Ratational.git` into terminal
  2. Run `main.cpp` 
  3. Input first fraction, then operation, and second fraction
  4. Click enter
  5. Output is produced on the next line
  
  ## Example 
  ```
  3/5 + 1/2
  11/10
  ```
